# DY NN Weight

Corrective Drell-Yan Weight Derivation via Neutral Networks

## Setup

The setup is tailored towards DESY resources and based on the environment defined by the UHH HH → bb𝜏𝜏 analysis.

### Clone the repository (once)

Clone the repository recursively to get all submodules.

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:uhh-cms/dy_nn_weight.git
```

### Setup the environment (every session)

Then, run the following command everytime you start a new session.
The first invocation will install required analysis environment and software once.

```bash
source setup.sh
```
